Microfrontend Root-Config
=========================

* * * * *

Well, look at you, stumbling upon *another* mind-blowing microfrontend masterpiece. This here is the root configuration for a bunch of MFs (Microfrontends, of course). I'm using **Single SPA** 🧩 to combine all these microfrontends into one place. So buckle up, because you're in for a real treat. 🎢

If you're dying to see this in action, here you go:\
**[Root MF URL](https://hi-malay.github.io/mf-root-config/)** 🌐

Click "employees" on this bad boy and *poof*, you'll load a new microfrontend:\
**[Employees MF](https://hi-malay.github.io/mf-root-config/employees)** 🎉

Pretty magical, huh? ✨

Installation
------------

* * * * *

Follow these incredibly complicated steps to get it running locally (if you dare):

1.  Clone the repo (you know the drill). 🛠️

2.  Run:

    bash

    Copy code

    `npm install
    npm run start`

See? Easy-peasy... even if it's just a "root config." 😌
