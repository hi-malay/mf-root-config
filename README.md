Microfrontend Root-Config
Well, look at you, stumbling upon another mind-blowing microfrontend masterpiece. This here is the root configuration for a bunch of MFs (Microfrontends, of course). I’m using Single SPA (you know, like the cool kids) to wrangle all these microfrontends into one place. So buckle up, because you're in for a real treat.

URL
If you’re dying to see this in action, here you go:
Root MF URL

Click "employees" on this bad boy and poof, you'll load a new microfrontend:
Employees MF

Pretty magical, huh?

Installation
Follow these incredibly complicated steps to get it running locally (if you dare):

Clone the repo (you know the drill).

Run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run start
See? Easy-peasy... even if it's just a "root config."

Related Repos
Oh, but there's more! Like an entire universe of related repos, and I'm sure you're thrilled to check them out one by one:

mf-employees: A React app, because obviously, why wouldn’t we use React?
mf-navbar: Another React app. What can I say? We love that JSX.
mf-employee-details: And here’s a twist—this one’s Angular. (Because who doesn’t love mixing frameworks?)
Contributions
If you’ve managed to find anything to improve in this flawless code, feel free to submit a PR. I’d be eternally grateful (and maybe even slightly impressed). But let’s be real—I doubt there’s much you’ll find.

Thanks for checking this out, and hey, maybe I’ll catch you around in my next totally amazing personal project. (Yeah, we’re all excited for that.)
